# Data Critique and Redesign: Global pet ownership data
Text here...

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

After looking through the different data sets and articles on the Makeover Monday website, I decided to go with one that had a topic that peaked my interest- pets. This was the original data visualization.

## Step two: the critique
There were many things that I liked about this visualization:

At the same time, there were many things that were not working for this visualization.

After reading Stephan Few's model on Effective Data Visualization, I can to the conclusion that this visualization was

## Step three: Sketch a solution
I first started by writing out what I though the original graphic was trying to accomplish- comparison of countries and comparison of pets within countries. I also realized that this data was more declarative than it was exploratory, and more data driven than conceptual- which led me to categorize this data visualization as an 'Everyday Data Viz', as referenced in the Good Charts textbook. 

I think moved into a few simple sketch ideas. My instinct was to do a bar chart, as this would allow the audience to make quick comparisons. 

I realized that drawing each of these by hand was not going to lead to the precision I wanted, especially with a stacked bar chart visualization model- so I turned to Tableau. 

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Interviewee | Feedback 1 | Feedback 2 | Feedback 3 |
|-------------|------------|------------|------------|
|  Student 1  |    The vertical position of the country names made it difficult to read    |     I had to think twice about whether the title meant people or households, but the subtitle helped        |
|  Student 2  |      Because the data adds up to over 100% and the data isn't showing how many people in each country own a pet, but specific pets, what if you separated the pet categories to be side by side?       |  Could switching the columns and rows help to be able to read the countries better?           |
|  Student 3  |    It is difficult to differentiate between the shade of blue and green- increased contrast or intentsity would help         |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
