# The final data story
> [https://preview.shorthand.com/OmrFH7vRAVEpA5C0](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/musics-effect-on-graduate-student-stress-levels/index.html)



# Changes made since Part II
> Since Part II, I have made quite a few adjustments to my data visualizations, particularly the bar graph representing my colleagues top motivations for listening to music. Here I changed the title to cue the audience in right away that mood and stress were the top 2 motivators for my colleagues. I also changed those two bars to a bright blue color and the others to a gray to highlight them even more.
>
> I also adjusted the arrow colors for the modified dot plot (the one that shows stress levels before and after listening to music), to match the bright blue from the bar chart above. This helped to bring cohesion to the graphics as well as help the numbers/findings stand out a bit more.
>
> The other big things I did was make sure that stand alone data points- mostly percentages, averages, etc- were large enough, bolded, and centered. Though these data points are not a chart, I want my audience to be able to see those points clearly, rather than hiding them in a paragraph of text.
>
> The biggest change I made from Part II to III has been adding in the narrative text arround my data visualizations. This narrative is absolutley necessary for a 1 minute presentation, but on its own I think my narrative paints a nice picture of the story I am telling, as well as why this story is important to me. My project topic was not an overly complicated one. And though this topic is backed by research, most of the research is looking into very specific elements, for example cortisol levels in saliva. For my audience, I wanted to make sure they knew that I had talked to people like them- which is why I decided to collect my own primary data. It is a simple story. And while there are research studies on which music you can listen to in order to lower your stress levels, everyone is different. This is why my final call to action doesn't include a playlist or recommendations, because my simple story concludes with the suggestion to listen to music that you enjoy. What works for me, may not work for you- which was demonstrated by my data collections from my colleagues.

## The audience
> Because my audience is graduate students, I know that they are used to seeing high levels of research and data from a variety of fields. Because I am presenting this during finals week, and because of the complex nature of the results of research on my topic, I didn't want to overcomplicate things. I wanted to put MY narrative at the center of my project.
