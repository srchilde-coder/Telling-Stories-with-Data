# User research 

In order to refine my story, I took into account who my audience is and the questions I plan to ask them in order to improve the clarity and impact. 

## Target audience
My target audience is:
- graduate students, and therefore likely high achieving, highly motivated, and prone to stress
- between the ages of 20-35
- all gender expressions and identities
- enjoys listening to music of all genres and for a variety of reasons
- receptive to resources for improving mental health

  
## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   Clear Story   |     Can you summarize the main points of the story?             |
|  Audience connects with story- emotional response  |    Did you identify with any of the statements or statistics?         |
| Impactful Graphics    |    Would the story have been the same without the data visualizations?              |
| Clean graphics     |       Walk me through your thoughts when you first looked at the data visualizations? Were they overwhelming?       |
| Clear graphics  |   Can you explain to me what each graphic represents? |
|  Clear call to action    |  What was your main take away from what you saw?            |

After walking my interviewees through my story and data visualizations, I will use the following script:

1) Can you summarize the main points of the story?
   
2) Did you feel connected to, or see yourself in any of the statistics?
   
3) What would the story be like without the data visualizations
   
4) What if I had only shown you the data visualizations?
   
5) *looking at a dataviz* Walk me through your thoughts when looking at this data visualization? What are your feelings? Do you feel overwhelmed, confused, clarity, excited, sad?
    
6) *looking at a dataviz* What does this graphic represent or mean to you?
    
7) *looking at a dataviz*  Is there anything that would make this graphic more clear?
    
8) What was your main take away from this story? Was there anything unclear or left unsaid?


## Interview findings

I received a ton of unstructured feedback during my "presentation" to my interviewees. A few takeaways from the more unstructured feedback included:
  - changing the color of my name from white to a darker color and the spacing/centering of the content on shorthord
  - using a different graphic for this:
<iframe title="Graduate students live at a constant state of stress" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-zAad2" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zAad2/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="403" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}})}();
</script>
