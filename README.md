# TSWD-portfolio-templates
These portfolio templates are for setting up your Telling Stories with Data site.  Edit these pages and add new ones as needed.   
It's always helpful to keep track of your web URL.  Consider putting that somewhere on your page for easy reference: 

- Web page URL: https://srchilde-coder.github.io/Telling-Stories-with-Data/ (check this- when clicked on rather than pasted/typed out, the website does not show updates)
- This repository: https://github.com/srchilde-coder/Telling-Stories-with-Data/

# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

## About me
Hi! My name is Samantha Childers and I am a current Master of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. As part of my studies, I have taken an interest in how to effectively communicate data with patrons, stakeholders, and audiences. Throughout this course, I hope to strength my storytelling abilities by creating effective and meaningful data visualizations. 

Prior to attending CMU, I taught high school chorus in North Carolina for 6 years. I also did a significant amount of work with Community arts, including community youth musical theater. I began to picture a new career for myself, one where I could expand my reach and impact within communities, while still continuing to work in music education and performance. My goal coming out of my Masters degree is to work in a performing arts nonprofit organization, potentially in education, community outreach, development, or even operations. I am using my time at CMU to learn as much as I can and to engage in all unique experiences possible. 


# What I hope to learn

1. What types of graphcis work best for different types of data or fields
2. Ways I can incorporate more data visualizations into the Arts Field
3. How to use new technologies and online tools to create graphics

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
Part III(final-project-part-three)

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

# practice:
**Bold text** *italic* ~~strikethrough~~

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  
![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca0d6929-4e58-4d05-8eff-81ede4559cd7)
*might need to review more on how to do this*
 

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>


Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
