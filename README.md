## About me
> Hi! My name is Samantha Childers and I am a current Master of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. As part of my studies, I have taken an interest in how to effectively communicate data with patrons, stakeholders, and audiences. Throughout this course, I hope to strength my storytelling abilities by creating effective and meaningful data visualizations. 

> Prior to attending CMU, I taught high school chorus in North Carolina for 6 years. I also did a significant amount of work in Community Arts, including community youth musical theater. I began to picture a new career for myself, one where I could expand my reach and impact within communities, while still continuing to work in music education and performance. My goal coming out of my Masters degree is to work in a performing arts nonprofit organization, potentially in education, community outreach, development, or even operations. I am using my time at CMU to learn as much as I can and to engage in all unique experiences possible.

1. What types of graphcis work best for different types of data or fields
2. Ways I can incorporate more data visualizations into the Arts Field
3. How to use new technologies and online tools to create graphics
