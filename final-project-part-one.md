# Outline
## **Music to the rescue in times of stress** | How listening to music can help Graduate students cope with stress 

Graduate programs are a wonderfully rewarding experience, but they also come with high expectations, high work loads, and high amounts of stress. A 2023 study showed that 34.8% of graduate students experience some level of anxiety.^[1]

I know from my experience as a music teacher, and musician myself, that music has all sorts of benefits. Music can be used to help relax, pass the time, as a hobby, distraction, a way to reduce stress, help focus, influence or lift our moods, and also to relate to our social groups.^[2] The field of research has been developing and exploring how music can affect our bodies and emotions, including dopamine and cortisol levels and short term memory.^[3] Newer professions like Music Therapy have emerged to help harness the power of music to “manage stress, alleviate pain, express feelings, enhance memory,”^[4] and more. A 2013 study concluded that “the transformative power of music is due to its ability to influence the brain, promoting neuroplasticity, and bringing about changes that can benefit health and wellbeing.”^[5] 

Speaking from personal experience, music has certainly helped me to regulate stress and anxiety, slow my heart rate, and improve my mood.

I am interested in showing visual representations of stress or anxiety we experience as grad students and how music has the ability to lower this stress. I will consult colleagues and gather data on their mental status/stress/anxiety before listening to music and after listening to music. 

I am also interested in exploring that though different types of music have different effects on our mood, in terms of reducing overall stress levels in the moment, it doesn’t necessarily matter what kind of music you listen to, as long as you enjoy it. 

## Rough strucutre
1) Graduate school as a major stressor- immediate audience connection
   
2) Music’s super power to affect our mood, reduce stress and anxiety, and overall health
   
3) Data viz on collected data
- Current stress levels
- Hours listening to music
- Mood before listening to favorite song
- Mood after listening to favorite song
   
4) Call to action: next time you are feeling stressed/pre-crash out, a good coping technique is to pop out your airpods and listen to your favorite song.
